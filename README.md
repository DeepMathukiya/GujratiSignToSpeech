# SignToSpeech â€“ Bridging Communication for the Deaf and Dumb

## Overview
**SignToSpeech** is an innovative solution designed to bridge the communication gap between the **deaf and dumb community** and ordinary people. This project focuses on translating **Gujarati Sign Language** into speech and vice versa, enabling seamless communication for people who use sign language to interact with non-signers.

The solution integrates **machine learning** and **AR technology** for real-time translation and visualization of gestures, making communication more inclusive.

## Features
- **Sign Language to Speech Translation**: Converts **Gujarati Sign Language** gestures into speech for easier communication.
- **Speech to Sign Generation**: Uses **AR technology** to convert spoken words into visual signs, helping non-signers understand the message.
- **Custom Dataset**: Curated a **custom dataset** for Gujarati Sign Language, as there were no publicly available datasets.
- **CNN Model for Gesture Recognition**: Built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for accurate sign language gesture classification.
- **Real-Time Translation**: Enables real-time communication with high accuracy using machine learning and AR technologies.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python, Flutter
- **Machine Learning**: CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)
- **AR Technology**: Augmented Reality (AR)
- **Hardware**: **Jetson Nano** for portable and real-time deployment
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, ARCore, Flutter, gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
